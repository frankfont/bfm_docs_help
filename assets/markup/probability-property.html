        <h1>Probabilities</h1>
        <p>Subscribers to the <b>Pro package</b> can enter and view probability estimates on individual workitems of a mission.</p>
        <p>This provides an automatic computation of probabilities throughout your mission model.</p>
        <p>
            The smart probabilities feature is activated by entering a probability value into at least one workitem.
        </p>

        <h2>Probability Values</h2>
        <p>
            Entries are numeric in the range [0.00,1.00] and are displayed up to 3 decimal places.
        </p>
        <p>
            Default probability for workitems without a user entry is 0.95.
        </p>

        <h2>Computed Probabilities</h2>
        <p>
            Probabilities are computed as simple products through the diagram without double-counting multiply linked contributors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>status setting</b> of a workitem contributes to the computed probability in the flow as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <div><b>Started and Review:</b> contribution of such a workitem is the normal probability of the workitem increased by half the difference of that value and <b>1</b>.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div><b>Completed and Abandoned:</b> contribution of such a workitem is the whole value <b>1</b>.</div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            A small symbol indicates whether a workitem contained a user provided probability entry or is simply the running computation at that point in the workflow.
