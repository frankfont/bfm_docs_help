        <h1>What is a Mission Diagram?</h1>
        A famous self-help author once wrote "begin with the end in mind." All mission diagrams have a clear end-goal.

        <div class="center">
            <img src="../img/screenshot-simplemission1.png">
        </div>

        <p>
            Mission diagrams clearly illustrate the key steps along the way to achieve your end-goal. All steps of the
            diagram lead toward that end-goal. Arrows in the illustration communicate this intuitively.
        </p>

        <p>
            Arrows connect goals. We work our way through the mission diagram from left to right, completing goals as we
            go.
            We tackle new goals as we complete the ones connected to their left until eventually we arrive at the
            end-goal
            of our mission.
        </p>

        <p>With very little explanation a mission diagram communicates what the mission is (end-goal) and how we will achieve it successfully (arrows and workitems along the way).</p>
