    <h1>Mission Diagram Recipes</h1>
    <p>
        Mission diagrams visualize the big picture of actionable steps toward your goals. The emphasis of the diagrams
        is what to do and the sequence in which the creators believe those actions can be taken. A foundational
        principle of the approach is also that these diagrams can be altered easily so they cut through fog rather than
        succumb to it. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Brainstorm to clarify your own thought processes</li>
        <li>Rapidly share clarity across a team of collaborators</li>
    </ul>
