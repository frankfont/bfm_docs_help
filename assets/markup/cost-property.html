        <h1>Cost Totals</h1>
        <p>Subscribers to the <b>Pro package</b> can enter and view monetary cost estimates on individual workitems of a mission.</p>
        <p>This provides insight into expected financial costs for workitems and the rollup totals at each step toward mission completion.</p>
        <p>The smart cost totals feature is activated by entering at least one cost value into a workitem.</p>

        <h2>Units of Effort</h2>
        <p>Entries are numeric and by default interpreted to be dollars.</p>

        <h2>Cost Totals</h2>
        <p>
            Totals are computed and displayed throughout the mission diagram. 
            A small symbol indicates whether a workitem contained a user provided cost entry or is simply the running total at that point in the workflow.
