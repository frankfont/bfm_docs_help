        <h1>Effort Totals</h1>
        <p>Subscribers to the <b>Pro package</b> can enter and view effort estimates on individual workitems of a mission.</p>
        <p>This provides a more granular insight into expected effort for a workitem beyond the inference conveyed by the selected workitem type shape.</p>
        <p>The smart effort totals feature is activated by entering at least one effort value into a workitem.</p>

        <h2>Units of Effort</h2>
        <p>Entries are numeric and by default interpreted to be hours. Values can also include suffixes as explained below.</p>

        <h2>Effort Totals</h2>
        <p>
            Totals are computed and displayed throughout the mission diagram. A small symbol indicates whether a workitem contained a user provided effort entry or is simply the running total at that point in the workflow.
